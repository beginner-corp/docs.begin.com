## Overview

In addition to provisioning and managing your app's infrastructure, Begin is also a fully integrated CI/CD build pipeline optimized for incredibly rapid deployments.

Begin builds spin up instantly and run in parallel, so you can build and deploy as quickly as you can push changes to your default GitHub branch, usually `master`.

Deployments to `staging` and `production` take only seconds and are instantly available at scale â€“ enjoy the benefits of near-instant iteration with frequent pushes!

The `Activity` view â€“ your default view in Begin - shows all your app's builds, its current deploy status, and corresponding build log data.


## Build pipeline

Begin offers three hosted environments out of the box: `testing`, `staging`, and `production`. Begin also supports full [local development](./working-locally), of course.

Within these hosted environments, Begin follows a fairly traditional CI/CD build pipeline:
- `testing` - Commits to the default branch kick off CI; green builds deploy to `staging`
- `staging` - Runs latest green build from your default branch; clicking the `Deploy to Production` button in the left nav in Begin (or cutting a git tag) deploys to `production`
- `production` - Runs the latest `production` release


## Deploying to `staging`

Each push to your default branch, usually `master`, kicks off Begin CI.

The last step for each green build is a `staging` deploy.

The version of your app currently running on `staging` is represented by the commit SHA, and can be found in the upper left corner of Begin.


## Deploying to `production`

Deploys to `production` can only occur when the latest `staging` build is green (i.e. all build steps passed without error).

Assuming your current build is green, cut a `production` release by:
- Using the `Deploy to Production` button in the left nav in Begin, or
- Creating a [git tag](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging), i.e.:
```bash
git tag -a 1.0.1 -m "This release includes 20% more cowbell"
git push origin 1.0.1
```
- Or also by creating a [Release in GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/)

The current running version on `production` is represented by the version you specified in your git tag (and is also found in the upper left corner of Begin).

> ðŸ‘“ Note: We strongly encourage the use of [SemVer](https://semver.org/) when creating `production` releases!


## Configuring build steps

Begin CI executes three default, non-configurable steps: ([`verify`](#verify), [`install`](#install), and [`deploy`](#deploy)); and three optional, configurable steps: [`build`](#build), [`lint`](#lint), and [`test`](#test). In order of execution:


### **Verify**

Responsible for validating the repo payload from git and prepping Begin's infrastructure for a deployment.

This step is non-configurable and does not output logs.


### **Install**

Responsible for installing dependencies to:
- The project root (`./`)
- Your project's cloud function directories (i.e. `src/http/**`)
- Your project's shared code, if any (i.e. `src/shared/`, `src/views/`)

This step is non-configurable and does output logs.

> Note: dependencies in your project's root `package.json` are not available to your individual Functions; you should treat deps in the root as developer dependencies only.
>
> To ensure a dependency is available to a given Function, `cd` into that function's folder and install it there.
>
> To install global deps, install them to `src/shared` â€“ but mind dependency bloat! **Function dirs must weigh in under 5MB uncompressed.**


### **Build**

**Optional**

Runs an arbitrary build script defined in your project's root `package.json` like so:

```js
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "./scripts/build"
  }
}
```

This is a great place to generate static assets (to be deployed via the `public/` folder) or implement a bundler such as Webpack or Parcel.


### **Lint**

**Optional, but highly recommended!**

Runs eslint by default (or the linter of your choice). Defined in your Begin app's default `package.json` (and for hopefully obvious reasons we strongly suggest not removing it):

```js
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint src --ignore-pattern node_modules --fix",
  }
}
```


### **Test**

**Optional, but highly recommended!**

Defines your test procedures. Like `lint`, it's defined in your Begin app's default `package.json` (and we strongly recommend expanding your app's tests):

```js
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "NODE_ENV=testing tape test/*-test.js | tap-spec"
  }
}
```

### **Deploy**

Ah, the step we've been waiting for!

Provided all other build steps `exit(0)`, Begin takes over again to manage deployment, which primarily includes:
- Deploying all Function folders to their corresponding cloud functions
- Deploying static assets (`public/*`) to your app's built-in blob store (S3) and CDN

The deploy step is non-configurable and does not currently output logs.

### **Changing the default Github branch**

Altering source control should be done with care and due diligence. Fortunately, the procedure is straightforward, but can become more complicated as you check for other downstream dependencies. Each service that depends on a git hook should be evaluated and your team needs to be informed of the migration procedure. 

- First, make sure you have a working backup of your existing default branch. 

- Next, rename your existing default branch to another name, like `main`.

```bash
git branch -m master main
```

From the git docs: 
>With a -m or -M option, <oldbranch> will be renamed to <newbranch>. If <oldbranch> had a corresponding reflog, it is renamed to match <newbranch>, and a reflog entry is created to remember the branch renaming. If <newbranch> exists, -M must be used to force the rename to happen.

- Then, push this newly renamed branch to Github

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

- Finally, change the default branch in Github by navigating to your Github repo > _Settings_ > _branches_. Then choose your newly named branch. It should appear in the drop down list as a result from the earlier push. If you are importing an existing repo with a custom default branch, no further configuration is required. Begin is set to operate on pushes to your default branch automatically.
