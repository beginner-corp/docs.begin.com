> ⏱ This tutorial is an introductory walkthrough of creating a React app on Begin. It should take fewer than 15 minutes.

## Introduction

**Hello there, Beginner!**

This tutorial uses the [Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) starter app, extended by Begin-based API endpoints. This means that you have the power of React for building beautiful user interfaces combined with the magic of cloud functions and data storage.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have **git** and **Node.js** installed to your local computer to follow along with this tutorial. (Learn more about [installing git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [installing Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).)

You'll also need a GitHub account. (Learn more about [signing up with GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-github).)

Although it would be helpful to have some experience with React, it is not required knowledge to follow along with this tutorial. The [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/) are a great resource for learning everything about React as well.

This tutorial also assumes some familiarity with such things as:
- Text editors
- Terminal / CLI
- Git and version control
- General software development using JavaScript

You do not need to be an expert in any of these things in order to follow along and make your first React app in Begin!

**Let's get started!**

## Getting started

### Create your new React app

First, click the **Deploy to Begin** button below. This starts the process of authorizing Begin with your GitHub account. (You may be prompted to log into GitHub, and/or be asked to create a Begin username.)

[![Deploy to Begin](https://static.begin.com/deploy-to-begin.svg)](https://begin.com/apps/create?template=https://github.com/begin-examples/node-create-react-app)


### Name your app & repo

You'll then be prompted to name your new app and repository – this is optional, feel free to use the default app and repo name if you like!

> Note: your Begin app name and repository name cannot be changed later.

Once you've clicked the `Create...` button, Begin will spin up your new project on GitHub (under `github.com/{your GH username}/{your repo name}`).

> By default your Begin app repo is created as a public GitHub repo; it can be set to private by granting Begin additional permissions from this screen (or later from the `Settings` screen found in the left nav of your Begin app).

## Your first deploy

After creating your app, you'll be taken to its `Activity` stream. Welcome to the main backend interface of your Begin app!

![Begin Activity view](/_static/screens/shared/begin-activity.jpg)

From the `Activity` view, you'll be able to watch your app build & deploy in real-time. Any time you push to `master`, you'll see a new build get kicked off in Begin.

Each build undergoes a number of predefined build steps (learn more about [build steps here](http://localhost:4445/en/getting-started/builds-deploys#configuring-build-steps)); these build steps may install your app's dependencies (`install`), test your code's syntax (`lint`), generate any files or assets needed to run your app (`build`), and/or run an automated test suite (`test`).

If no build steps fail, then the build containing your latest commit to `master` is automatically deployed to your `staging` environment.

Go ahead and click the **Staging** link in the upper left corner of your left nav to open your new app's `staging` URL. You should now see your react app:

## Make your first commit

If you'd like to jump right into making your first commit and running your first build, click the `Edit on GitHub` button. This will open your app's code in GitHub and allow you to make a quick change.

![Begin activity](/_static/screens/guides/personal-website/begin-activity-2.jpg)

Look for this code, and try editing your basic app. Let's edit the `<p>` that says "Change me!" to "My App!":

```javascript
// Customize your site by changing the data below
return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>{message}</p>
        <p>My App!</p>
```

Click the **commit changes** button on GitHub, and head back to your `Activity` view to watch it build.

When it's done, don't forget to see your changes live in your `staging` environment!

---

## Get set up locally

Next let's get your new site running in your local environment (i.e. the computer you work on).

First, head to your GitHub repo (from the first card in your `Activity`, or from the left nav). Find the **clone or download** button and copy the git URL.

Then head to your terminal and clone your repo to your local filesystem.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/your-new-begin-app.git
```

Once you've got your project cloned on your local machine, `cd` into the project directory, install your dependencies, and start the local dev server:
```bash
cd your-new-begin-app
npm install
npm start
```

You should see a `localhost` link in your terminal – go ahead and visit that in your browser.

That's all you need to do preview your changes locally before pushing them to `staging`!

## Project structure

Now that your app is live on `staging` and running locally, let's take a quick look into how the project itself is structured so you'll know your way around. Here are the key folders and files in the source tree of your personal website:

```bash
.
├── public/
├── src/
│    ├── http/
│    │   └── get-api/
│    └── App.js/
│
└── test/
```

Let's go over each of these directories and how you may use them:
