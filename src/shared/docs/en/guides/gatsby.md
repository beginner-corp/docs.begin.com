# Begin basic Gatsby app + API

> ⏱ This guide should require less than 5 minutes

[Gatsby's](gatsby,org) starter app, extended by Begin-based API endpoints.

First let's review what you need to get going.

## Prerequisites

While this guide assumes general familiarity with such things as text editors, terminal interfaces, git, and basic software development in JS with Node.js, you do not need to be a CTO to use Begin (or this guide)!


### tl;dr, you'll need:
- A (free) GitHub account
- Any computer running macOS, Windows, or Linux, with:
  - Node.js 10
  - NPM 6.x
- Gatsby installed globally on your system.


## Create a Begin account

To create a Begin account, simply click the `Login` button on the [Begin home page](https://begin.com), authorize it with GitHub, and pick a username. That's it!


## Create an app

![Begin new app selector](/_static/screens/begin-app-create-selection.jpg)

After creating your Begin account, select the Gatsby Starter from the list of starter apps to build from.

Then name your app and repo, and Begin will spin up your new project repository under `github.com/{your GH username}/{your repo name}`, and populate it with a fully functional Begin app.

> By default your Begin app repo is created as a public GitHub repo; it can be set to private by granting Begin additional permissions via in the `Settings` screen found in the left nav of your Begin app.

## Getting started

### Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Start the local dev server

```
npm start
```

### Compile & hot-reload for development

```
npm run serve
```

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

_Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

### Compile for production

If you're already familiar with Gatsby, take note that your usual cli commands `gatsby develop`, `gatsby build`, etc will not run in this environment. Use the commands below to build and deploy your app.

```
npm run build
```

### Lint & fix files

```
npm run lint
```

### Run your tests

```
npm run test
```

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
