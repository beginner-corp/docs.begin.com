> ⏱ This tutorial is an introductory walkthrough of creating a personal website on Begin. It should take fewer than 5 minutes.

## Introduction

**Hello there, Beginner!**

This tutorial walks through setting up a Svelte app running on Begin. [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app. Today you will learn how to create a Svelte app powered by Begin HTTP functions.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have **git** and **Node.js** installed to your local computer to follow along with this tutorial. (Learn more about [installing git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [installing Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).)

You'll also need a GitHub account. (Learn more about [signing up with GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-github).)

This tutorial also assumes some familiarity with such things as:
- Text editors
- Terminal / CLI
- Git and version control
- General software development using JavaScript

You do not need to be an expert in any of these things in order to follow along and make a new personal website with Begin!

**Let's get started!**

## Getting started

### Create your Svelte app

First, click the **Deploy to Begin** button below. This starts the process of authorizing Begin with your GitHub account. (You may be prompted to log into GitHub, and/or be asked to create a Begin username.)

[![Deploy to Begin](https://static.begin.com/deploy-to-begin.svg)](https://begin.com/apps/create?template=https://github.com/begin-examples/node-svelte)


### Name your app & repo

You'll then be prompted to name your new app and repository – this is optional, feel free to use the default app and repo name if you like!

> Note: your Begin app name and repository name cannot be changed later.

Once you've clicked the `Create...` button, Begin will spin up your new project on GitHub (under `github.com/{your GH username}/{your repo name}`).

> By default your Begin app repo is created as a public GitHub repo; it can be set to private by granting Begin additional permissions from this screen (or later from the `Settings` screen found in the left nav of your Begin app).

## Your first deploy

After creating your app, you'll be taken to its `Activity` stream. Welcome to the main backend interface of your Begin app!

From the `Activity` view, you'll be able to watch your app build & deploy in real-time. Any time you push to `master`, you'll see a new build get kicked off in Begin.

Each build undergoes a number of predefined build steps (learn more about [build steps here](https://docs.begin.com/en/getting-started/builds-deploys#configuring-build-steps)); these build steps may install your app's dependencies (`install`), test your code's syntax (`lint`), generate any files or assets needed to run your app (`build`), and/or run an automated test suite (`test`).

If no build steps fail, then the build containing your latest commit to `master` is automatically deployed to your `staging` environment.

Go ahead and click the **Staging** link in the upper left corner of your left nav to open your new app's `staging` URL. You should now see your basic Svelte app:

## Make your first commit

If you'd like to jump right into making your first commit and running your first build, click the `Edit on GitHub` button. This will open your app's code in GitHub and allow you to make a quick change.

![Begin activity](/_static/screens/shared/begin-activity-2.jpg)

Look for this code, and try changing the color of the `h1` tag:

```js
// Customize your site by changing the color of the h1
<script>
  import { onMount } from 'svelte'
  export let message;
  onMount(async () => {
    let data = await (await fetch('/api')).json()
    message = data.msg
    console.log('MESSAGE: ', message)
  })
</script>

<style>
  h1 {
    color: purple;
  }
</style>

<h1>{message}</h1>
<h2>Change me!</h2>

```

Click the **commit changes** button on GitHub, and head back to your `Activity` view to watch it build.

When it's done, don't forget to see your changes live in your `staging` environment!
